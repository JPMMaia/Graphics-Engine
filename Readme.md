# Graphics Engine

This project started as a hobby but ended being used for building a demo scene for the course [Real-Time Rendering](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/courses/Realtime/VU.html) @ TU Wien. Classified as the best project of the class in the 2016 Winter Semester and part of the [Hall of Fame](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/courses/Realtime/HallOfFame/index.html) of the course.

The following video demonstrastes the demo scene:
